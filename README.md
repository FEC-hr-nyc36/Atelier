## Front End Capstone Project

We are a two person team of developers who created a mock product page for an e-commerce site focusing on the front-end of our application. We used advanced frameworks such as React and Redux to build this application out over 3 weeks using a mock business requirements document. The data that we used was supplied to us from a blackbox API.
